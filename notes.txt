Notes:
---------------------
-ORIENTATION
  -LOOK DOWN +Z

-enemy class
  -fix orientation of enemies
  -when too far off screen they need to be removed

-weapon/projectile damage
  -weapon effects projectile damage
  -projectile has its own damage variable

-you died state

-extend factory to make factory1
  -this new child class will act as a level
  -so then we can hand build a level in these extended classes

-smarter pickups so that they are more procedural
  -so we dont need to manually set them up when we want to test certain shit.

fix the bar scaling messing up the position---- almost right
set pickups as a trigger and not actualy cause velicty changes as it does now


Perlin Noise:
---------------------
simplex works perlin does not


Question:
---------------------

-time manipulation (i have found the answer to this once, i forgot however)
  -slow down time, this includes gravity in simulation
-Can you have a single rig used with multiple meshes, with proper weights, for example, clothes for characters?

COLLISION LAYERS AND MASKS
--------------------------------
layers:                       masks:
000001 = (1)character          111100 (60)
000010 = (2)character bullets  111000 (56)
000100 = (4)pickups            100001 (33)
001000 = (8)enemy bullets      100001 (33)
010000 = (16)enemies           100011 (35) 110011 (51)(collide with other enemies)
100000 = (32)env               111111 (63)
