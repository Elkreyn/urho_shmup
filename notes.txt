Notes:
---------------------
-enemy class
i have a factory now
i need to give the guy some movement
-need to also look at the damn collisino masks, they seem wanky

-weapon/projectile damage
weapon effects projectile damage
projectile has its own damage variable

-smarter pickups so that they are more procedural
so we dont need to manually set them up when we want to test certain shit.

-understand collision layers and masks, they make no sense at the moment.
bullets need not collide with other bullets etc

fix the bar scaling messing up the position----almost
-reduce health at collision


Perlin Noise:
---------------------
simplex works perlin does not

Future:

Question:
---------------------

-time manipulation
  -slow down time, this includes gravity in simulation
-need to figure out a way to disclude certain object from effecting some objects in sim
  -there appears to be a mask that can be used
-Can you have a single rig used with multiple meshes, with proper weights, for example, clothes for characters?
