Notes:
---------------------

I should make a focus node, that the camera actually follows. (camera target)
as well as a bounding box that player is allowed to be in.
maybe this ox is attached to the follow node, and it all moves forward at a set pace. as well as the character.
-or I can just translate thing out, to fake the motion

look at setting up pick ups that will change the weapon that the character has.

enemy class

fix the bar scaling messing up the position----almost
-reduce health at collision


Perlin Noise:
---------------------
simplex works perlin does not

Future:

Question:
---------------------

-time manipulation
  -slow down time, this includes gravity in simulation
-need to figure out a way to disclude certain object from effecting some objects in sim
  -there appears to be a mask that can be used
-Can you have a single rig used with multiple meshes, with proper weights, for example, clothes for characters?
