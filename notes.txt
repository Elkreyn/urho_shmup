THIS IS THE NEW BRANCH FOR SHMUPS

character/pawn class

Main_2:
---------------------

I should make a focus node, that the camera actually follows.
  This can trail behind the main character, but also allows me to avaerage what is on screen at one time
  or something along those lines
maybe we need a weapon class that fires off the projectile class
put some of these classes in folder for organization


fix the bar scaling messing up the position----almost
-reduce health at collision


Perlin Noise:
---------------------
simplex works perlin does not

Future:
---------------------


Question:
---------------------

-time manipulation
  -slow down time, this includes gravity in simulation
-need to figure out a way to disclude certain object from effecting some objects in sim
  -there appears to be a mask that can be used
-Can you have a single rig used with multiple meshes, with proper weights, for example, clothes for characters?
